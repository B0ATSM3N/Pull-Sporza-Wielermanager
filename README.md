# Wielermanager-startlist-checker

This python script checks an excel file containing the rider data from the sporza wielermanager game.
It then checks the procyclingstats website to see if the rider is on the startlist.

It generates and updates a sheet called results where you can find per race if a rider is found on the startlist.
It also counts the number of races a rider rides.
